                <h2>First Female Teacher Of India</h2>
                <p><b>Savitribai Phule</b> was born on 3 January 1831 in the village of Naigaon in Satara District,
                    Maharashtra. Her birthplace was about fifteen km from Shirval and about 50 km from
                    Pune. Savitribai Phule was the youngest daughter of Lakshmi and Khandoji Nevase Patil, both of
                    whom belonged to the Mali Community. She had three siblings. Savitribai was married to her
                    husband Jyotirao Phule at the age of 9 or 10 (he was 13). Savitribai and Jyotirao had no children of
                    their own. It is said that they adopted Yashawantrao, a son born to a Brahmin widow. However,
                    there is no original evidence available yet to support this. It is said when Yashwant was about
                    to get married, no one was willing to give him a girl because he was born to a widow. Hence
                    Savitribai arranged his marriage to her organization's worker Dynoba Sasane's daughter in February
                    1889.
                    After completing her teacher's education, Savitribai Phule started teaching girls at the
                    Maharwada in Pune. She did so alongside Sagunabai Kshirsagar who was a revolutionary feminist as
                    well as a mentor to Jyotirao. Not long after beginning to teach with Sagunabai,
                    Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule along with Sagunabai started their own school at Bhide Wada. Bhide
                    Wada was the home of Tatya Saheb Bhide, who was inspired by the work that the trio was doing. The
                    curriculum at Bhide Wada included traditional western curriculum of mathematics, science, and social
                    studies. By the end of 1851,</p>
